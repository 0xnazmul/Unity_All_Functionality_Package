# Unity All Functionality Package 🎮

A **ready-to-use collection of Unity packages** for building **Hyper-Casual** and other mobile games faster.  
This repository provides modular `.unitypackage` files covering **game mechanics, UI, ads, audio, camera, and more** – so you don’t need to rewrite common functionality every time you start a new project.

## 📦 Included Packages

Each `.unitypackage` is independent – import only what you need:

- **AudioManager** – Centralized audio control (music, SFX, mute/unmute).  
- **ColorSwitcher** – Easy color theme swapping for objects/UI.  
- **FollowCam** – Smooth camera follow script for player or objects.  
- **Jump** – Plug-and-play character jump mechanic.  
- **LoginPage** – Simple UI template for login/signup flow.  
- **SwipeController** – Mobile swipe input handler.  
- **TilesSpawn** – Infinite tile spawning system (great for endless runners).  
- **UIManager** – Common UI controls & transitions.  
- **AdsManager** – Easy integration layer for showing ads in your game.
